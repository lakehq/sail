          subjectPatternError: |
            The subject "{subject}" in the pull request title does not match the configured pattern.
            Please ensure that the subject does not start with an uppercase letter.
            If the subject contains words that should start with an uppercase letter (e.g. "Rust"),
            consider rephrasing the subject so that such words are not at the start.
