# All the scripts used in this workflow come from the commit specified by `inputs.ref`,
# which can be different from the commit that defines the workflow.
# We assume that the scripts are compatible with the workflow definition between the two commits.
# Otherwise, we may encounter errors such as "file not found" when the workflow invokes
# a script that does not exist in the commit being tested.
# Therefore, when you have both script changes and workflow changes, you should consider
# separating them into two pull requests. For example, you can add a script in one pull request
# and update the workflow to invoke the script in a follow-up pull request.
