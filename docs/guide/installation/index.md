# Installation

Sail is available as a Python package on PyPI. You can install it using `pip`.

```bash
pip install pysail
```

::: info

Currenctly, only a source-only pre-release is available, so you need the Rust toolchain to install Sail.
A proper release with pre-built wheels will be available soon.
