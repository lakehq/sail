# Data Storage

Sail supports various storage solutions, including file systems and cloud storage services.

You can use the `SparkSession.read` and `SparkSession.write` API to load data from and write data to the storage.

You can also use the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement to create a table that refers to data stored in the storage.

Here is a summary of the supported (:white_check_mark:) and unsupported (:x:) storage features for reading and writing data. There are also features that are planned in our roadmap (:construction:).

| Storage                        | Read Support       | Write Support      |
