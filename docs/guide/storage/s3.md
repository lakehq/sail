# AWS S3

## AWS Credentials

You can configure AWS credentials using standard methods supported by the AWS tools and SDKs.
These methods include AWS `config` and `credentials` files,
EC2 instance profiles, and AWS access keys configured in environment variables.

::: info
You can refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html)
for more details about the credential providers.
:::

## AWS Region

If the AWS region is configured, all S3 buckets must be in the same region.
Otherwise, an error will be returned when accessing the data.

To allow inferring regions for S3 buckets and accessing S3 data in all regions, you can set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable to an empty string.

## Accessing Public Data on AWS S3

Some datasets on S3 allow public access without an AWS account.
You can skip retrieving AWS credentials by setting the environment variable `AWS_SKIP_SIGNATURE=true`.

::: info
`AWS_SKIP_SIGNATURE` is not a standard environment variable used by AWS SDKs.
It is an environment variable recognized by Sail.
