# Data Formats

Sail supports various data formats for reading and writing.

You can use the `SparkSession.read`, `DataFrame.write`, and `DataFrame.writeTo()` API to load and save data in different
formats.
You can also use the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement to create a table that refers to data stored in a specific format.

Here is a summary of the supported (:white_check_mark:) and unsupported (:x:) data formats for reading and writing data.
There are also features that are planned in our roadmap (:construction:).
