# Introduction

Sail is a compute engine well-positioned in the _composable data stack_. It is built on top of solid foundations such as the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) in-memory format and the [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) query engine.
Sail delivers value from data at scale, no matter how and where the data is stored.

If you are already using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), you can switch to Sail **without making code changes**, and enjoy the benefits delivered by a modern system programming language (Rust) and design principles tailored to the modern compute world.
