# Introduction

**Sail** :sailboat: is an open-source compute engine designed for both single-host and distributed settings. Our mission is to **unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive (AI) workloads**. Organizations choose Sail because it accelerates execution, reduces resource consumption, simplifies data infrastructure, and enables seamless migration.

Today's cloud environments and data workloads pose challenges not anticipated by solutions developed a decade ago. **If you are already using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), you can switch to Sail without making changes to your Spark code**, and enjoy the benefits delivered by a modern system programming language (Rust) and design principles tailored to the modern compute world.

Sail is well-positioned in the _composable data stack_. It is built on top of solid foundations such as the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) in-memory format and the [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) query engine. We are working on integrations with the [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) DataFrame library, lakehouse formats, and additional cloud storage engines. We hope Sail can assist you in delivering value from data at scale, no matter how and where the data is stored.
