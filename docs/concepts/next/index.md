# Next Steps

You have now completed the journey of understanding what Sail is, how to use it, and how it works.
You are welcome to revisit the documentation site occasionally as we add more content in the future.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on [Slack](https://lakesail.com/slack) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/discussions).
You can also submit bug reports or feature requests on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/issues).

You may also be interested in the [Reference](/reference/), which provides detailed information about the Sail API and configuration options.

If you want to contribute to the project, please check out our [Development](/development/) handbook. We look forward to your [pull requests](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/pulls) on GitHub!
