# Welcome

Welcome to the Sail documentation!

The mission of Sail is to unify stream processing, batch processing, and compute-intensive (AI) workloads.
Currently, Sail features a drop-in replacement for Spark SQL and the Spark DataFrame API in single-process settings.

You can start with the [User Guide](/guide/) to learn more about Sail.

The [Development Guide](/development/) provides information on how to contribute to Sail.
It covers the development process and Sail internals.

The [Reference](/reference/) can be handy when you want to look up the Sail API documentation.
