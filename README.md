# Sail

[![Build Status](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/lakehq/sail/actions)
[![PyPI Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pysail)](https://pypi.org/project/pysail/)

The mission of Sail is to unify stream processing, batch processing, and compute-intensive (AI) workloads.
Currently, Sail features a drop-in replacement for Spark SQL and the Spark DataFrame API in single-process settings.

## Installation

Sail is available as a Python package on PyPI. You can install it using `pip`.

```bash
pip install pysail
```

**Note**: Currently only a source-only pre-release is available, so you need the Rust toolchain to install Sail.
A proper release with pre-built wheels will be available soon.
