The mission of Sail is to unify stream processing, batch processing, and compute-intensive (AI) workloads.
Currently, Sail features a drop-in replacement for Spark SQL and the Spark DataFrame API in both single-host and distributed settings.

## Installation

Sail is available as a Python package on PyPI. You can install it using `pip`.

```bash
pip install pysail
```

Alternatively, you can install Sail from source for better performance for your hardware architecture.
You can follow the [Installation](https://docs.lakesail.com/sail/latest/guide/installation/) guide for more information.

## Getting Started

### Starting the Sail Server

**Option 1: Command Line Interface** You can start the local Sail server using the `sail` command.

```bash
sail spark server --port 50051
```

**Option 2: Python API** You can start the local Sail server using the Python API.

```python
from pysail.spark import SparkConnectServer

server = SparkConnectServer(port=50051)
server.start(background=False)
```

**Option 3: Kubernetes** You can deploy Sail on Kubernetes and run Sail in cluster mode for distributed processing.
Please refer to the [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](https://docs.lakesail.com/sail/latest/guide/deployment/kubernetes.html) for instructions on building the Docker image and writing the Kubernetes manifest YAML file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f sail.yaml
kubectl -n sail port-forward service/sail-spark-server 50051:50051
```

### Connecting to the Sail Server

Once you have a running Sail server, you can connect to it in PySpark.
No changes are needed in your PySpark code!

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.remote(f"sc://localhost:50051").getOrCreate()
spark.sql("SELECT 1 + 1").show()
```

Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://docs.lakesail.com/sail/latest/guide/getting-started/) guide for further details.
